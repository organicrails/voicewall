## VoiceWall

This CRUD application demonstrates the use of RSPec, Capybara, and FactoryGirl in basic TDD testing. Voiewall is an application that allows users to post anything they'd like to say, though the core important of this application lies within the TDD tests. All the tests can be found within the spec folder.

The detailed walkthrough of this application can be found [here!](http://organicrails.github.io/2015-08-14-Voicewall/)
